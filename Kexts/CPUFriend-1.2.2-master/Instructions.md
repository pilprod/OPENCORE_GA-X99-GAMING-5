CPUFriend Installation & Usage
===================================

## WARNING
In most cases the native CPU power management data from `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` or `X86PlatformPlugin` work out of the box. Do NOT use CPUFriend for data customization until one knows clearly what *power management data* really is. Instead, changing SMBIOS, which results in other data being used, can be more reasonable. [FrequencyVectors.bt](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend/blob/master/Tools/FrequencyVectors.bt) can be a good start for the analysis of `FrequencyVectors`. *Another thing worth mentioning is that CPUFriend should NOT be used only for patching LFM (Low Frequency Mode), particularly on mobile models including MacBook series.*

#### Technical background
- Function `configResourceCallback()` from `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` or `X86PlatformPlugin` is hooked so as to handle customized CPU power management data from user. If nothing is provided, CPUFriend does nothing and the original data is to be used as if this kext is not installed.

#### Installation
Injection via bootloader is highly recommended, or [LiluFriend](https://github.com/PMheart/LiluFriend) may be needed to ensure full functionality when installing to system folders such as `/Library/Extensions`.
Both `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` and `X86PlatformPlugin` should remain untouched.

#### Available kernel flags
Add `-cpufdbg` to enable debug logging (ONLY available in DEBUG binaries).

Add `-cpufoff` to disable CPUFriend entirely.

Add `-cpufbeta` to enable CPUFriend on unsupported OS versions.

#### Configuration
`Tools/ResourceConverter.sh` is meant to generate a working copy of either `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` or `ssdt_data.dsl`, from which CPUFriend reads data.

**NOTE:** Where there is another SSDT generated by [ssdtPRGen.sh](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh), combination between `ssdt_data.dsl` and the SSDT table produced by this script is required. See [Data Combination](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend/blob/master/Instructions.md#data-combination) for further details. For simplicity, `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` is preferred in this case.

#### Usage of ResourceConverter.sh
`--kext /path/to/file`
	Create `CPUFriendDataProvider.kext` with information provided by `file`.
	
`--acpi /path/to/file`
	Create `ssdt_data.dsl` with information provided by `file`.

**NOTE:**
- The kext/ssdt produced is located at the current working directory that can be revealed with `pwd`.
-  `file` should be a ***complete plist*** from `Recources` inside `ACPI_SMC_PlatformPlugin` or `X86PlatformPlugin` ***with certain modifications*** (Otherwise why is CPUFriend even required?) instead of something like a raw `FrequencyVectors` entry.

#### Data Combination
1. Generate a correct copy of `ssdt_data.dsl` with `./ResourceConverter.sh --acpi /path/to/file`.
2. Open SSDT previously generated by [ssdtPRGen.sh](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh), and search for `Method (_DSM, 4, NotSerialized)` in a text editor.
3. Paste `"cf-frequency-data"` entry from `ssdt_data.dsl` to the SSDT generated by [ssdtPRGen.sh](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh). A glance at the final work looks as follows.
```
	//
	// Context of the SSDT generated by ssdtPRGen.sh
	//
	Method (_DSM, 4, NotSerialized)
	{
		If (LEqual (Arg2, Zero))
		{
			Return (Buffer (One)
			{
				0x03
			})
		}

		Return (Package () // size removed
		{
			"plugin-type", 
			One,

			//
			// Paste it from ssdt_data.dsl
			//
			"cf-frequency-data",
			Buffer () // size removed
			{
				// Data from ssdt_data.dsl
			}
		})
	}
	//
	// Context of the SSDT generated by ssdtPRGen.sh
	//
```
